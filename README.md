# ILNP
Great nail polish, bad user experience. Can I do it better?

##### Tuesday, December 24th
Merry Christmas Eve -- Phase Negative One is complete! I completely reworked the foundation: fixed store, mapped components, cleaned up/organized files, and more. I am much more pleased with the current state of this project, so I think it is time to finally start working on more functional aspects of the site, such as Cart and Sort.

It's been about one month since I've done any major updates to this project. I've been focused on getting through my React Native course... but as graduation approaches, so does the deadline for releasing v1.0. Looking at my code, I get the same feeling as you would upon discovering that your entire house needs an electrical re-wiring. I see now that it was a mistake to build the visual elements around the functionality, instead of the other way around. To put this project in a releasable/presentable state, I'm going to have to take a few steps back. Entering Phase Negative One: re-working the foundation!

I've officially completed my React course! Let's continue putting my skills to the test with this project. I added two nail polish collections (Snowed In, Monarchy) plus gift cards to the store, then separated them into their own pages. Going to add a few more collections, then attempt to render everything on the Home page using react-horizontal-scrolling-menu.

The foundation is set! Header, NavBar, Body, and Footer are all in place and looking acceptable for now. Entering Phase Two: implementing Redux and adding products.

Today marks the first day of my attempt at overhauling a crappy website. I love ILNP, but I was shopping on there the other day and thought, "*Dang this website sucks.*" Coincidentally, I have been learning React over the past few weeks and need to come up with a project to showcase my skills! If I can pull this off, I think it will be a nice addition to my portfolio. Here goes!
