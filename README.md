# ILNP
Great nail polish, bad user experience. Can I do it better?

##### Wednesday, November 20th
I've officially completed my React course! Let's continue putting my skills to the test with this project. I added two nail polish collections (Snowed In, Monarchy) plus gift cards to the store, then separated them into their own pages. Going to add a few more collections, then attempt to render everything on the Home page using react-horizontal-scrolling-menu.

The foundation is set! Header, NavBar, Body, and Footer are all in place and looking acceptable for now. Entering Phase Two: implementing Redux and adding products.

Today marks the first day of my attempt at overhauling a crappy website. I love ILNP, but I was shopping on there the other day and thought, "*Dang this website sucks.*" Coincidentally, I have been learning React over the past few weeks and need to come up with a project to showcase my skills! If I can pull this off, I think it will be a nice addition to my portfolio. Here goes!
