### Great Nail Polish, Bad User Experience. Can I do it better?


#### About
I love nail polish, and ILNP has been one of my favorite brands for a while now. I was browsing their website trying to shop, and was actually getting frustrated with how sluggish the whole process was! At that time, I was only a couple weeks into my React course and this poor user experience is what finally made it all click for me. I realized that this exact website could be entirely re-built in React and function one million times faster! Lo and behold, after some tinkering, I was correct. This project absolutely made me fall in love with React.

#### Features
This site utilises React, Redux, Reactstrap, and FontAwesome. It features favorite and cart functionality, and is my most ambitious project as of this writing.

#### What I Learned
* I struggled to understand React for a few weeks, and attempting to learn it was actually discouraging at first. In the beginning, working on this project felt like one of those Escape Room challenges; being stuck in a room and digging around for clues until you find something that works, then moving onto the next room, etc. I saw a feature I wanted to implement, and I experimented until I figured out how. Eventually, I had a working app and was actually very proud of what I'd accomplished.

* Originally, I had built this app without Redux and my data was all over the place! I reached a point where I could no longer progress because my foundation was so shoddy. I took it upon myself to read over Redux docs to figure out how to properly set up a Store and access that data from anywhere in my project, and after a complete project overhaul, I was successful.
